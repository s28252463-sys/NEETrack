/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for NEETrack App
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data
 * and allows public read access to syllabus-related data.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /syllabi/{syllabusId}: Stores syllabus data, publicly readable.
 * - /syllabi/{syllabusId}/subjects/{subjectId}: Stores subjects within a syllabus, publicly readable.
 * - /syllabi/{syllabusId}/subjects/{subjectId}/chapters/{chapterId}: Stores chapters within a subject, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/chapterCompletions/{chapterId}: Stores chapter completion statuses, accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/studyGoals/{studyGoalId}: Stores study goals, accessible only by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/mockTests/{mockTestId}: Stores mock test results, accessible only by the user.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only access their own profile and associated data (chapter completions, study goals, mock tests).
 * - Syllabus, Subject and Chapter data is publicly readable.
 * - Listing other user's data is forbidden.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - User-specific data is stored under the /users/{userId} collection group,
 *   allowing easy path-based ownership checks without additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 * - User-specific data is segregated under the /users/{userId} collection group,
 *   while syllabus and related data is stored in top-level collections for public read access.
