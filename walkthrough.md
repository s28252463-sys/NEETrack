# Walkthrough: Coastal Focus & Functional Enhancements

## Overview
I have completed the redesign of the Pomodoro Timer to match the "Coastal Focus" theme and added requested functional enhancements, including a dedicated Feedback Page accessible from the main sidebar.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Visual Theme: "Coastal Focus"
-   **Split Layout**: Deep Navy (#0f2040) top section (65%) and Warm Sand (#cbb08a) bottom section (35%).
-   **Nature Timer**: Clean white ring with a custom **Leaf Icon** that follows the progress tip.
-   **UI Elements**: Minimalist "GO" button (Navy pill on Sand) and clean settings dialog.
-   **Text Selectors**: Replaced dot indicators with clear **Text Buttons** ("FOCUS TIME", "SHORT BREAK", "LONG BREAK").

### 2. Functional Enhancements
-   **Mode Text**: The current mode is displayed above the timer ring.
-   **Alert Sounds**: Integrated a custom `SoundManager` with realistic bell sounds.
-   **Feedback Page**: Created a motivating `/feedback` page with the "Coastal Focus" theme.
-   **Navigation**:
    -   Added a "Feedback" link to the main application **Sidebar** (desktop) and **Menu** (mobile).
    -   Updated the "Back" link on the Feedback page to return to the **Dashboard**.

## Verification
-   **Visuals**: Verified the split background, leaf animation, text selectors, and feedback page design.
-   **Audio**: Verified that sounds play correctly.
-   **Navigation**: Confirmed the Feedback link in the sidebar works and the Back link returns to the dashboard.
